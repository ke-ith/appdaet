Final Project Proposal for our subject APPDAET.

Project Title: WeatherSense App: Real-Time Weather Monitoring and Forecast Visualization using Tkinter and Open-Meteo API

Project Overview: This project aims to build a program capable of retrieving weather information for any city the user specifies using real-time weather information and short-term forecast visualization. Built with Tkinter, 
the system enables users to input any city name, which is automatically converted into geographic coordinates through a geocoding API. It then retrieves accurate weather data from the Open-Meteo API, displaying temperature, 
wind speed, and descriptive weather with icon emoji. In addition, the application also generates a line chart using Matplotlib to show the next 24-hour temperature forecast at hourly intervals. This will help users understand 
short-term weather patterns more clearly. This project serves as a tool for students, educators, and individuals who need simple, accessible, and interactive weather viewers without requiring API keys or complex setup.
